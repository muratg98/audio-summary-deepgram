# 🎙️ GP AI Audio Summarizer

A desktop tool for recording, transcribing, and summarizing GP–patient consultations using Deepgram AI.
Built with Python, Tkinter, and the Deepgram API, it aims to help clinicians quickly review conversations and produce concise summaries for better patient care.

## 🚀 Features

- One-click recording – Capture audio directly from your microphone.

- Automatic transcription – Convert audio files (.wav, .mp3, .mp4) to text using Deepgram’s transcription model.

- AI-powered summarization – Generate short, structured summaries from transcripts.

- Local file management – All recordings, transcripts, and summaries are stored in a GP Client Audio folder on your desktop.

- User-friendly interface – Built with Tkinter for a clean, minimal GUI.

## 💡 Why I Built This

With a background in Health Psychology (MSc) and experience in full-stack development, I wanted to explore how technology can make healthcare workflows smoother and more efficient.
My pharmacist friend and I were talking and this issue had arrised - in many consultations, GPs face time pressure and need to quickly review notes — this tool combines speech-to-text transcription with AI summarization to save time, guarantee appointment reasonings, and reduce unnecessary work load. The GP AI Audio Summarizer was a project to step toward building healthcare-focused tools that improve both patient outcomes and practitioner efficiency.
